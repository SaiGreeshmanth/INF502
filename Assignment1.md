1. List all the branches in this repository and, for each branch, list the commits.

    - Use `git branch` to list the branches in this repository.
    - Use `git checkout` to explore each branch.
    - Use `git log --decorate` to explore the structure of commits.

```
* master
  math

```

2. Try `git log --graph --all` to see the commit tree. Paste the result here and write a paragraph to provide an interpretation of what you found.
```


```

3. Use `git diff BRANCH_NAME` to view the differences from a branch and the current branch. Summarize the difference from master to the other branch.

```


```

4. Write a command sequence to merge the non-master branch into `master`.

```


```


5. Write a command (or sequence) to (i) create a new branch called `math` (from the `master`) and (ii) change to this branch.

```


```
   
6. Edit B.py adding the following source code below the content you have there.
```
print 'I know math, look:'
print 2+2
```

7. Write a command (or sequence) to commit your changes.
```


```

8. Change back to the `master` branch and change B.py adding the following source code (commit your change to `master`):
```
print 'hello world!'
```

9. Write a command sequence to merge the `math` branch into `master` and describe what happened.
```


```
   
10. Write a set of commands to abort the merge.
```


```
   
11. Now repeat item 9, but proceed with the manual merge (editing B.py). All implemented methods are needed. Explain your procedure.
```


```

12. Write a command (or set of commands) to proceed with the merge and make `master` branch up-to-date.
```


```

13. Complete Part 2. Then, come back here and answer the following:
Report your experience of submitting the Part 2. Please, include the steps you followed, the commands you used, and the hurdles you faced (within the file you created for the **Part 1**).
```

### Part 2: Using GitHub

The goal of this assignment is to put you in touch with the fork-pull request process, with an extra of dealing a little bit with Markdown. To learn more about Markdown [click here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

To complete this submission, follow these steps:

1. Fork the course repository (available [here](https://github.com/chavesana/INF502-Fall22)).

2. Into the students folder, create a markdown file called LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.md (please change LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME for your actual last and first names). 

3. Use markdown to write a report of the last paper you've read. You can structure your markdown the way you want, but the following information must be there:
- Title
- Venue (journal name/conference)
- Number of pages
- Three outcomes of the paper
- Link to the paper online

4. Commit your file and push to your own GitHub repository (INF502).

5. Create a pull request to the course repository. Your pull request needs to appear [here](https://github.com/chavesana/INF502-Fall22/pulls).

6. Go back to Part 1 and answer the question 13 based on your experience in solving Part 2.

Your Part 2 submission is complete when your pull request is listed in the link above.
